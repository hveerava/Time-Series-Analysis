# Time-Series-Analysis

## Overview:
This project is a simple C++ library for analyzing time series data, providing functionalities for forecasting, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.

## Features:
- Forecasting: Predict future values in time series data.
- Anomaly Detection: Identify outliers or unusual patterns in the data.
- Pattern Recognition: Recognize common patterns like trends or seasonality.
- Simple Interface: Easy-to-use functions and classes for analyzing time series data.
- Modular Design: Organized into separate header and implementation files for easy integration and maintenance.

## Usage:
- Include necessary header files in your project.
- Create instances of classes like TimeSeries, ARIMA, AnomalyDetector, and PatternRecognizer.
- Call Methods: Use the provided methods to perform analysis on your time series data.
- Compile your C++ program using a C++ compiler and run the executable to analyze your data.

## Requirements:
- C++ compiler with support for C++11 or later.
- Common library headers like <vector>, <string>, <cmath>, etc.
- Development environment like Visual Studio, Xcode, or command-line tools. (not necessary)
